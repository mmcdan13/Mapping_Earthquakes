# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to display earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, as well as all of the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map. This will be accomplished with the use of JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and API calls to retrieve geoJSON data.
